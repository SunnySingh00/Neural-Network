# Neural-Network
This is a programming assignment done for the CSCI 567 - Machine Learning class.

The code implmenents a sample Neural network with 5 hidden layers. It also implments various activation functions like

1) Tanh
2) Relu

SGD optimizer is used to evaluate the loss function along with a droupout to prevent overfitting.

neural_network.py and utils.py implements the algorithm for MLP. This is a complete implementation that is also provided with a test dataset on mnist.

To run the above code: $ python neural_network.py
